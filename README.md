A simple To-Do List web application built with **TypeScript**. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks in a list.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to your To-Do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit existing tasks directly in the list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Strike-through**: Mark tasks as completed by checking them off (strike-through effect).
